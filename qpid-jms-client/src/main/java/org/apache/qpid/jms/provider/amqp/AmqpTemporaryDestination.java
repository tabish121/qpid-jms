 * Manages a Temporary Destination linked to a given Connection.
 *
 * In order to create a temporary destination and keep it active for the life of the connection
 * we must create a sender with a dynamic target value.  Once the sender is open we can read
 * the actual name assigned by the broker from the target and that is the real temporary
 * destination that we will return.
 *
 * The open of the Sender instance will also allow us to catch any security errors from
 * the broker in the case where the user does not have authorization to access temporary
